# Techtronics--Power-BI-Analysis
This project focused on solving Techtronixâ€™s challenges in demand forecasting, inventory inefficiencies, and market expansion. Using PowerBI, I analysed sales trends, customer behaviour, and inventory data to improve demand forecasting and reduce stock inefficiencies. The insights enhanced decision-making, improved efficiency, and increased revenue.


Techtronix Innovations faced challenges in demand forecasting, inventory inefficiencies, and market expansion. Inconsistent demand led to stock shortages or overproduction, limiting profitability and growth.

I used Power BI to analyse sales trends, optimise inventory, and uncover new market opportunities. I cleaned the data and built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualise sales performance, demand patterns, and market trends.

Through demand forecasting and data-driven insights, I helped minimise inventory mismatches, improve stock planning, and identify high-margin products and growth markets. The insights enabled leadership to make informed decisions through my insight analysis and recommendations.
